## Requirements

1. Download and Install Python 3. If you already have Python installed, skip this step.

2. Pull down or download the project repository.

## Running

1. Using any IDE or text editor go to 'databaseCreation.py' and run that file either right-click and run the file, or run the file in the terminal. Make sure you run this step first since this file builds the database. The file 'main.py' will not work properly without this file being executed first.

2. Then go to 'main.py' and right click to run the file locally in the terminal to run the SQL queries. You can see the SQL query outputs in the terminal.
